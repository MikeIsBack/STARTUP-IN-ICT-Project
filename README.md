# Startup-in-ICT-Project

A project for the Startup in ICT course - MSc Computer Science - Universit√† degli Studi di Padova.

## DocHub (Simulate your Startup!)

In this course students are required to simulate their own startups by applying the theoretical concepts explained by the Professor during the course. The entire course and the concept of "startup" itself is based on bringing progress to the world. First you will be asked to identify a real problem that affects our society and then you should find a way to solve it effectively by launching your startup and presenting your ideas with a pitch in front of the Professor and a group of real investors to convince them to invest money in you.

In this repository you can find all the material we used to launch DocHub, a startup with the aim of simplifying the retrieval of digital documents in Italy by developing a platform that collects in one place all the digital documents of a person, simplifying the daily life of people.
